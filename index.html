    <h1>GHANIAN NAMES</h1>
         <p>
            This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week 
            they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
                <br>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given 
            their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were 
            born. Here are Ghanian day names.

            Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the 
            week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week 
            from a specific date.
