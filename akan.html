            This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week 
            they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
                <br>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given 
            their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were 
            born. Here are Ghanian day names.
